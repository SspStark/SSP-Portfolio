          <p>
            Hey there! I&#39;m Sai Siva Prasad, a recent graduate in Computer
            Science and Engineering, class of 2023. With a passion for
            technology and a hunger for new challenges, I&#39;m currently
            seeking opportunities in Full Stack Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my academic journey, I delved into programming and software
            development in Nxtwave, honing my problem-solving skills with
            Python. My journey into Full Stack Development was an immersive
            experience at Nxtwave, mastering the SQLite and MERN (MongoDB,
            Express.js, React, Node.js) Stackâ€”a cutting-edge technology stack
            known for its versatility and scalability, expanding my toolkit for
            diverse projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;m excited to apply my skills to real-world projects,
            collaborating with passionate teams to create innovative solutions.
            With a drive for learning and growth, I&#39;m eager to explore new
            technologies and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of
            software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let&#39;s connect and explore how we can work together to turn ideas
            into reality!
